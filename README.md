# Stress-Detector
API to detect real time stress using Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks and Flask (to link the API).

**Dataset**
Kaggle Facial Expression Recognition dataset.

**Process**:
- [x] 7 Layer CNN Model 
- [x] Dataset Trained on 7 emotions
- [x] Test functions to identify facial landmarks
- [x] Calculate the value for stress based on distance in eye and lip
- [x] Display the stress level and value on frame
- [x] Link Model to API using Flask

**Technologies required**:
1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
3. OpenCV
4. dlib for better facial identification
5. face utills to identify facial landmarks
6. Dataset classified into 7 emotions
7. 68 facial point.dat file 
8. Flask to link model to API
